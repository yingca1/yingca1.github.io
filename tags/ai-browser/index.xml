Positioned within a rapidly expanding AI browser market, projected to reach $76.8 billion by 2034, Comet challenges the dominance of traditional browsers like Google Chrome, which currently holds a 68% market share.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The core vision behind Comet is to evolve from an &amp;ldquo;answer engine&amp;rdquo; to an &amp;ldquo;action engine,&amp;rdquo; seamlessly integrating AI into the user&amp;rsquo;s workflow to amplify intelligence and reduce friction. This strategic pivot is a response to the commoditization of pure &amp;ldquo;answer engines&amp;rdquo; as major players like Google and OpenAI integrate real-time search into their foundational models.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
